# PHP_registerUsers
User registration example where you can connect to a MySQL database and register new users, view users and amend user information. Users have the ability to change their password. This is a personal project to work on my backend end development, wouldn't necessarily recommend for deployment. Also includes Bootstrap. 
Project is strcturede just as you would normally have a website with a datbase, outside the web directory for some added security.
