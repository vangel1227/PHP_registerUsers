<div class="page-header"><h1>PHP Projects</h1></div>
<p>Here is a collection of some of my PHP projects. All of these were self taught, studying through various mediums (books, YouTube, articles, blogs, etc.). In addition to the self taught PHP and MySQL, I also implemented some basic utilization of bootstrap.
    If you'd like to amend the looks of the site feel free to check out the documentation for Bootstrap <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Here</a>.

    Projects included here incorporating MySQL and PHP to create a user databse where you can view, update and delete user information. There is also a change password feature as long as you know the username and password. Other features include sorting information obtained
    from a MySQL database and presenting it in a table as well as paginating and formating the tables.
